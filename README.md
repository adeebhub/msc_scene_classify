# scene_classify
Scene_Classify is a deep CNN classification project that presents the implementation of Inception_-ResNet_v2 model as a feature extractor in classifying scene images with concentration to the visualisation of the feature vectors that are instrumental in both spatial and local recognition.

# Libraries and Dataset
The CNN was built using Tensorflow slim and the classification was performed on 6000 images from 15 categories of places365 dataset. The task was performed against three classes obtained from categorizing the 15 categories into three categories; a custom word-map of (i) Conveyor, (ii) Indoor and (iii) outdoor.
